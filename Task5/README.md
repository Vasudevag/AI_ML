# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests – Heart Disease Classification

This notebook uses the Heart Disease dataset to implement and evaluate tree-based models.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Train and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier
- Compare accuracy with Random Forest Classifier
- Interpret feature importance
- Apply cross-validation for robustness

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. Loaded and scaled the dataset
2. Trained a Decision Tree with controlled depth
3. Visualized the tree structure
4. Trained a Random Forest model
5. Compared accuracy, feature importance, and classification reports
6. Evaluated both models using 5-fold cross-validation
