# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing - Titanic Dataset

This repository contains the solution to **Task 1** of the AI & ML Internship program. The goal of this task was to clean and preprocess a dataset so it's ready for machine learning models.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Normalize/standardize features
- Visualize and remove outliers
- Save the cleaned dataset for future ML use

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn (for scaling)

---

## 📁 Files in this Repo

- `task1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete code
- `cleaned_titanic.csv`: Final cleaned dataset
- `README.md`: This file

## 🔍 Dataset

Dataset used: [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 🚀 Key Steps

1. Loaded the Titanic dataset
2. Explored the structure and missing values
3. Filled missing `Age` with median and `Embarked` with mode
4. Dropped `Cabin` due to high null values
5. Encoded `Sex` and `Embarked` using one-hot encoding
6. Scaled `Age` and `Fare` using `StandardScaler`
7. Detected outliers using boxplots
8. Saved the cleaned dataset to `cleaned_titanic.csv`
