# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Breast Cancer Classification

This notebook trains SVM classifiers on the Breast Cancer dataset using both linear and RBF kernels.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Train and evaluate SVM classifiers
- Compare linear vs. RBF kernels
- Tune hyperparameters (C and gamma)
- Perform cross-validation

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset
2. Scaled features using StandardScaler
3. Trained linear and RBF kernel SVMs
4. Evaluated accuracy and classification reports
5. Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
6. Evaluated robustness with 5-fold cross-validation
